# Stair Craft Math

Changes the output of the stair crafting recipe to "make sense":


6 Blocks are used to create blocks that are only 75% filled,   
thus it should produce 8 stairs.

**Stonecutter:** Gets obsoleted, but cannot really be respected as it only consumes single blocks.   
As stairs are crafted "correctly" in the table, why not stairs?

Only the resulting quantity is changed.
