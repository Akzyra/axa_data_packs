# Stair Craft Math

Changes the output of the stair crafting recipe to "make sense":

    6 * 1.00 = 8 * 0.75

**Stonecutter:** Gets obsoleted, but cannot really be respected as it only consumes single blocks.   
As slabs are crafted "correctly" in the table, why not stairs?


## Recipes

Only the resulting quantity is changed to 8 stairs.
