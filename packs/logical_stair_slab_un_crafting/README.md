# Logical Stair + Slab (Un-)Crafting

## Logical Crafting

Changes the output of the stair crafting recipe to "make sense":

    6 * 1.00 = 8 * 0.75

**Stonecutter:** Gets obsoleted, but cannot really be respected as it only consumes single blocks.   
As slabs are crafted "correctly" in the table, why not stairs?   
(Plus wood won't work, unless you tweak it to be an everything cutter)

## Stair + Slab Uncrafting

Allows crafting of stairs and slabs back to blocks. Existing slab crafting was changed if needed.


## Recipes

Only the resulting quantity is changed to 8 stairs.
