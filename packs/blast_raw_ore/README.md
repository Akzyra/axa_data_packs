# Blast Raw Ore

Smelt raw ore blocks into metal blocks in the **Blast Furnace**.

- Smelt duration of ore blocks is 8× that of single raw ore to "make it nicer":
  - **Datapack + Coal:** 1 coal smelts 1 ore block
  - **Datapack + Coal Blocks:** 1 coal block smelts 10 ore blocks
    - *Coal blocks smelting 10x more than Coal is [vanilla behavior](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Block_of_Coal#Fuel)*
  - **Datapack + Lava:** 1 lava bucket smelts 12.5 ore blocks
- Experience is 9× that of single raw ore
