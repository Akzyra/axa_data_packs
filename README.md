# axa_data_packs & pack_maker

## Datapacks

My personal Minecraft datapacks.

All of them are very simple and only touch one small aspect, mostly crafting recipes.

> **All packs have a README, check it for details.** \
> [➡️ Go to `packs` folder](packs/)


### Credits for inspiration

No files copied, but I liked the ideas so I remade them from scratch with some tweaks.

- Vanilla Tweaks
- Husks drop Sand


## pack_maker

Collection of utility scripts for reading and creating minecraft JSON files
Mostly used to generate crafting recipes automatically.
