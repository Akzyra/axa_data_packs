# Expected storage blocks

Makes blocks that seem like storage blocks but are not unpack into their base item:

- Quartz Block
- Clay Block
- Glowstone

These are currently in this pack, but might split into a seperate extension as 
they are changing vanilla aspects:

- Deco Quartz (allows undoing of processing; Smooth, Chiseled, Bricks, Pillar)
- Nether Wart Block (breaks potion progression, no nether wart planting, no warped unpacking)
- Brick Block (brick is rarely assumed as a storage block)
